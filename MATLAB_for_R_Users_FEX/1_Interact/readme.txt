MATLAB for R Users in Computational Finance
Demo 1 - Data Import & Exploration

This example contains the files necessary to demonstrate interactively importing and visually exploring data in MATLAB. priceData.xlsx contains electricity market prices for the New England region. These can be imported using the MATLAB import wizard. The electricity prices can then be visualized, brushed and explored.
